        <p>The <a href="{{ url }}">welcome page</a> greets a user when the user visits GraphSpace. We assume that the
            user has already created an account and uploaded graphs via the upload page or the RESTful API.</p>
        <br>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/log_in.png"></img>
        <br><br>

        <br>
        <p>The user logs in and is provided a link to the list of graphs that the user can access.</p>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/logged_in.png"></img>
        <br><br>
        <br>
        <p>Clicking on the link titled "Graphs" takes the user to a page that lists the graphs accessible by the user.
            In this example, this user owns 33 graphs and can access public graphs. No graphs are shared with this
            user.</p>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/graphs.png"></img>

    </div>

    <div id="in_search">
        <h2 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;">Searching within Multiple Graphs</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The user searches this list for graphs that contain the protein CTNNB1 (the symbol for &beta;-catenin, a
            transcriptional regulator in the Wnt signaling pathway) obtaining a reduced list of graphs. The selection of
            the button "Similar" means that the any protein whose label or identifier contains "CTNNB1" as a substring
            will match this search. This image shows the result of this search. There are six graphs owned by the user
            and two public graphs that contain this protein. Each link in the "Graph Id" column will take the user to a
            specific graph with the search term highlighted.</p>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/graph_search.png"></img>

        <br><br>
        <p>The user clicks on the graph with the id "KEGG-Wnt-signaling-pathway" and reaches the graph for the Wnt
            pathway with the searched node highlighted.</p>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/view_graph.png"></img>

    </div>

    <div id="search_single">
        <h2 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;">Searching within a Single Graph</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The same search interface greets the user on the page for this graph, which allows the user to add more
            search terms for nodes (Wnt in this example).</p>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/in_search.png"></img>
        <br><br>
        <p>The user can also add search terms for edges ("Wnt:Fzd" in this example). Since the user has selected the
            "similar" option for the search, any edge whose tail node identifier or label contains "Wnt" and whose head
            node identifier or label contains "Fzd" matches the query.</p>
        <br>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/search_edge.png"></img>
        <br><br>
        <p>By selecting an "Exact" option, the user can perform a new search for nodes that are an exact match to the
            query, which is "BAMBI" in this figure.</p>
        <br>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/bambi.png"></img>
        <br><br>
        <p>Figure 9: GraphSpace also supports exact searches for edges.</p>

    <div id="graph_interaction">
        <h2 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;">Interacting with a Graph</h2>
        <p>As its name suggests, the "Graph details" panel displays information about the entire graph, e.g., a legend
            of node and edge shapes and colors.</p>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/interact_1.png"></img>
        <br><br>
        <p>Clicking on a node pops up a panel with information on that node.</p>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/interact_2.png"></img>
        <br><br>
        <br>
        <p>Clicking on a edge pops up a panel with information on that edge. The information that appears in "Graph
            Details" and the pop-up panels must be included in the JSON for the graph uploaded by the user using the
            RESTful API.</p>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/interact_3.png"></img>

        <br><br>
        <p>A user can export a graph in PNG format and view the JSON string for the graph. GraphSpace does not support
            any other export formats since it relies on Cytoscape.js for this functionality, which implements only
            export to PNG format.</p>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/interact_4.png"></img>

    <div id="auto_layouts">
        <h2 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;">Automatic and Manual Layouts</h2>
        <p>The layout panel for a graph displays two alternatives: automatic and manual.</p>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/auto_1.png"></img>
        <br><br>
        <p>Clicking on the first choice reveals the name of layout algorithms supported by GraphSpace through its use of
            Cytoscape.js.</p>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/auto_2.png"></img>
        <br><br>
        <p>Clicking on the "Manual" tab shows that there are two "Private" layouts, meaning that the user has not yet
            shared them with any other user. The user has created them in earlier sessions by manually modifying the
            positions of nodes and edges created by some automatic layout algorithm and saving the layout. The icons
            next to each layout name provide (i) a direct link to this layout, (ii) allow the user to change its name,
            (iii) share it with other users who have access to this graph, (iv) delete this layout, and (v) make it the
            default layout, i.e., instruct GraphSpace to display this layout whenever a user visits the page for this
            graph.</p>
        <img width="80%" height="80%" align="middle" src="../../static/images/auto_3.png"></img>
        <br><br>
        <p>The user selects to view the layout titled "manual-top-to-bottom".</p>
